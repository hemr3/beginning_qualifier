	#code for converting bam files into NEANDERTHAL GENOME fasta files
	#uses samtools toolkit
	#the samtools fasta -f 4 command DOES NOT WORK
	


#found something that works!! 
# 1 -> slice out the region you want from the .bam file. 
# 2 -> take this gene.bam and then use samtools consensus to get the FASTA file

	#"chrnumber:gene_start-gene_end"
	#this is for the entire gene (consensus sequence, though), so its all the isoforms. 
samtools view chr22.rh.bam -h "22:20017023-20067164" > out.bam
	#when overlooking code - the -h flag may not be entirely necessary - doesn't seem to add much?


	#this does not give all of the headers of a normal FASTA file, but does give the sequence and chr identifier
samtools consensus -f fasta gene.bam > gene.fa

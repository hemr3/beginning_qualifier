## on the terminal - had problems with missing eof markers at end of downloaded bam files -
## from site: http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Chagyrskaya/
## tried with another individual (Vi33), also didn't work. Something with my code - don't know what
## adding eof markers did not allow the conversion (see addeof.py script in repository)

bedtools bedtobam -i ~/Documents/namedchr22.bed -g GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa.fai > ~/Documents/chr22.bam
        #using human genome as alignment - N + H = almost 1:1 comparison
        #this command completes without issue 
        
#then tried the samtools fasta conversion

samtools fasta ~/Documents/chr22.bam > ~/Documents/chr22.fa
       #no errors occur (no eof marker error), but the output is a file with 0bytes
[M::bam2fq_mainloop] discarded 0 singletons
[M::bam2fq_mainloop] processed 0 reads


#fasta file needed as reference for orthofinder. 
#could use human, but slightly less accurate for what is needed (ie creation of proteome files using vcf2prot tool)
#vcf2prot tool is on bioRxiv

#TROUBLE-SHOOTING ALREADY DONE:
        #using downloaded .bam files and created .bam from .bed files - both produced the same 0byte file, downloaded .bam had missing eof markers
        #unzipping and recompressing files using bgzip and tabix-ing them
        #using uncompressed files
        #.py file to add eof markers to end of downloaded .bam file 
                #the .py script doesn't recognise the downloaded .bam files as .bam files
        #using different toolkits - bedtools, samtools, homegrown ones found on stackoverflow
        #/tmp/ overflow corrected with deletion and restarting to clear directory

#POTENTIAL ISSUES
        #.bam files used here are chr by chr. perhaps this is an issue because samtools expects whole genome
                #SOLUTION: compress all .bam chr files into one
        #mislabelling on one of the columns between reference fasta file (GR38) - i.e. chr22 and 22 
                #SOLUTION:change labelling on .bam files or .bed files
        #using incorrect reference fasta for the creation of homegrown .bam files
                #SOLUTION:use the correct one (GR37?)
        #something is still wrong with my /tmp/ file      
                #SOLUTION: increase size of linux partition on pc
        #samtools expects the .bam / .bed files to have different headers
                #SOLUTION: change the headers to what toolkit expects (BUT HOW?)
        #creation of N fasta files may not be necessary to create the proteome 
                #SOLUTION: use the human one to the vcf2prot tool and see if it works

samtools fasta ~/Documents/Vi33.19.chr22.indel_realn.bam > ~/Documents/Vin22.fa
        #annoyingly,works with Vi33 chr22 file, for some godforsaken reason. but unsure whether it creates the 
        #correct files - will need to ask
        # website is currently down - can't test it with any of the other types of chag .bam file r/n

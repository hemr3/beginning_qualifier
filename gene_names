#bed files created in __________ have a | delimiter, not tab
#of course, i could fix this earlier in my code, but honestly its the same steps

#this does not work really well for literally anything else, so it must be converted:
sed 's/|/\t/g' ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/gene_names_chag3.txt > ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt

#then remove the stop position
awk '{print $2}' ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt > ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt

#remove duplicates
awk '!x[$0]++' ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt > only_names_chag3.txt

#remove lines that have more than one gene name on them (without removing Ensembl gene lines)
awk 'length<19' ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt > ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/try2_only_names.txt

#remove the semicolon and the quote marks:
cat ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/try2_only_names.txt | tr -d '"' | tr -d ';' > only_names.txt

#take only Ensembl gene lines to convert:
cat ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt | grep '^EN' > ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/ensembl_chag3.txt


#for specific genes - you first need to create a bed file with the format chrom number  start stop for that particular gene
#this can be found by looking on the .bed files made and essentially just copying/grepping them into a new file 
#once done, use the VCFs and this new .bed file to create a new VCF with only these gene positions in:
vcftools --gzvcf ~/Documents/chag_vcfs/chr3.noRB.vcf.gz --bed ~/Documents/traip.bed --out ~/Documents/traip_chr3_chag --recode --keep-INFO-all

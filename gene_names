#bed files created in __________ have a | delimiter, not tab
#of course, i could fix this earlier in my code, but honestly its the same steps

#this does not work really well for literally anything else, so it must be converted:
sed 's/|/\t/g' ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/gene_names_chag3.txt > ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt

#then remove the stop position
awk '{print $2}' ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt > ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt

#remove duplicates
awk '!x[$0]++' ~/Documents/gene_bed_files_chag/only_names_chag3.txt > only_names_chag3.txt
